# When to Stop?

One of my favorite problems in math is the secretary problem. Essentially, you are tasked with interviewing 100 secretaries and after each secretary leaves, you must offer them the job or deny them the job, on the spot. The natural approach is to interview a sample of them at the beginning to "test the playing field", then find the next best person after that.
